=== morse : MOdelling tools for Reproduction and Survival data in Ecotoxicology ===

Version 2.2.0
=============

NEW FEATURES
- the method plotDoseResponse replaces the plot.survData and plot.reproData
  when the argument target.time was set. Now the response is expressed in
  survival rate or in number of offspring per individual-days.
- the calcul of the mean fitted curve of 'plot.reproFitTT' and 'plot.survFitTT'
  is the same of the 95 % Credible limits.
- the ci arg in 'plot.reproFitTT' and 'plot.survFitTT' was suppressed and the
  credible limites was allways plotted.
- added a new argument 'adddata' in 'plot.reproFitTT' and 'plot.survFitTT'
  to draw the datas with theyre confidence interval.
- add a new argument 'spaghetti' in 'plot.reproFitTT' and 'plot.survFitTT'
  to draw the credible interval as multiple curves.

Version 2.1.1
=============

BUG FIXES
- update the cross-references link to ggplot2 package

Version 2.1.0
=============

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
- JAGS version 4.0.0 or higher is required
- rjags version 4.4 or higher is required

NEW FEATURES
- the dataset cadmium2 now reports the number of eggs instead of the number of
  clutches.
- add S3 method ppc to plot the posterior predictive check on reproFitTT and
  survFitTT objects.
- added a new argument 'remove.someLabels' to plot.reproData and plot.survData
  functions to avoid the overlap of labels of the X-axis in ggplot style.

BUG FIXES
- the check on replicate's label has been removed in the survDatacheck
  function.
- minor changes in the tutorial vignette.
- remove titles in legend of plot.reproFitTT and plot.survFitTT in
  ggplot style.
- remove observed value points in plot.reproFitTT.
- survDataCheck and reproDataCheck would fail on datasets with integer-only
  concentrations.
- the summary functions for survData and reproData now don't show the
  number of datapoints per concentration and the number of datapoints
  per time. This was considered misleading in the case where some
  replicates have a different initial number of individuals.
- plot.survData (and plot.reproData) don't display a legend anymore with
  unconstrained time and concentration. They used to display a misleading
  "replicate" legend, which would not correspond to a real replication unit
  (beaker).
- in plot.survData all ggplot style graphique start at 0,0.

OTHER CHANGES
- the DIC is not calculated in survFiTT anymore. Since we don't
  perform model selection, this was not really useful and we thus
  obtain a significant speed-up.
- the column ID was removed in survData and reproData objects.


Version 2.0.0
=============

NEW FEATURES
- new package structure and function names.
- the repro.data function is now called reproData and creates an object of class
  reproData without specific target time.
- the repro.check.data function is now called reproDataCheck.
- the repro.fullsurvplot and repro.cumulplot functions are replaced by the generic
  plot S3 method for the class reproData.
- the repro.survplot function now depends on the plot S3 metod for the new class
  survData.
- the repro.fit function is now called reproFitTT with the associated class
  reproFitTT, with the argument target.time.
- add of new arguments for the reproFitTT function:
  - "stoc.part" to choose the stochastic part of the model.
  - "ecx" to choose the value of ECx estimated by the function.
  - the deterministic part name are now in the legend of the plot function.
  - when stoc.part = "bestfit" is choosen, the model "gammapoisson" is chosen if
    the DIC of gamma-poisson model is smaller than DIC of poisson model of 10
    (1 in the previous version).
- upgrade the informations in the summary of the reproData class.
- upgrade the informations in the summary of the reproFitTT function, and values
  of parameters are expressed in untransformed values.
- the credible interval in plot.reproFitTT are now a ribbon.
- add a new group of functions to analyze survival data:
  - the survDataCheck function checks the integrity of the dataset.
  - the survData function with associated S3 method creates survData object.
  - the survFitTT function run the bayesian estimation to fit an exposure-response
    model for survival data with the associated specific S3 method: print, plot
    and summary.
- the lattice graphics was suppressed.
- the repro.convergence function was suppressed.

BUGS FIXES
- new selection rules for the "bestfit" method in the function reproFitTT.
- in log scale the points at concentration = 0 are not drawn (ggplot).

Version 1.0.2
=============

BUG FIXES
- correction of points color in the legend for the plot.repro.fit function (ggplot).
- change the ylim range for the plot.repro.fit function (generic).
- correction of the log.scale option for the repro.survplot function.

Version 1.0.1
=============

- Initial release.
