=== morse : MOdelling tools for Reproduction and Survival data in Ecotoxicology ===

version dev
===========

BUG FIXES
- plot.survData (and plot.reproData) don't display a legend anymore with
  unconstrained time and concentration. They used to display a misleading
  "replicate" legend, which would not correspond to a real replication unit
  (beaker).

Version 2.1.0
=============

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
- JAGS version 4.0.0 or higher is required
- rjags version 4.4 or higher is required

NEW FEATURES
- the dataset cadmium2 now reports the number of eggs instead of the number of
  clutches.
- add S3 method ppc to plot the posterior predictive check on reproFitTT and
  survFitTT objects.
- added a new argument 'remove.someLabels' to plot.reproData and plot.survData
  functions to avoid the overlap of labels of the X-axis in ggplot style.

BUG FIXES
- the check on replicate's label has been removed in the survDatacheck
  function.
- minor changes in the tutorial vignette.
- remove titles in legend of plot.reproFitTT and plot.survFitTT in
  ggplot style.
- remove observed value points in plot.reproFitTT.


Version 2.0.0
=============

NEW FEATURES
- new package structure and function names.
- the repro.data function is now called reproData and creates an object of class
  reproData without specific target time.
- the repro.check.data function is now called reproDataCheck.
- the repro.fullsurvplot and repro.cumulplot functions are replaced by the generic
  plot S3 method for the class reproData.
- the repro.survplot function now depends on the plot S3 metod for the new class
  survData.
- the repro.fit function is now called reproFitTT with the associated class
  reproFitTT, with the argument target.time.
- add of new arguments for the reproFitTT function:
  - "stoc.part" to choose the stochastic part of the model.
  - "ecx" to choose the value of ECx estimated by the function.
  - the deterministic part name are now in the legend of the plot function.
  - when stoc.part = "bestfit" is choosen, the model "gammapoisson" is chosen if
    the DIC of gamma-poisson model is smaller than DIC of poisson model of 10
    (1 in the previous version).
- upgrade the informations in the summary of the reproData class.
- upgrade the informations in the summary of the reproFitTT function, and values
  of parameters are expressed in untransformed values.
- the credible interval in plot.reproFitTT are now a ribbon.
- add a new group of functions to analyze survival data:
  - the survDataCheck function checks the integrity of the dataset.
  - the survData function with associated S3 method creates survData object.
  - the survFitTT function run the bayesian estimation to fit an exposure-response
    model for survival data with the associated specific S3 method: print, plot
    and summary.
- the lattice graphics was suppressed.
- the repro.convergence function was suppressed.

BUGS FIXES
- new selection rules for the "bestfit" method in the function reproFitTT.
- in log scale the points at concentration = 0 are not drawn (ggplot).

Version 1.0.2
=============

BUG FIXES
- correction of points color in the legend for the plot.repro.fit function (ggplot).
- change the ylim range for the plot.repro.fit function (generic).
- correction of the log.scale option for the repro.survplot function.

Version 1.0.1
=============

- Initial release.
